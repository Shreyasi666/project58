        <p>Reading is my favorite hobby. I just find it so fun and so amazing to read ANY book in particular. I mostly like fantasy and adventurous books, It just makes me feel like I'm with the narrator, sometimes exploring a secret, in the battle with the enemies, Authors truly make some wonderful books that speaks to me! I enjoy reading a lot in my free time its a very calming experience, I love books! I got this hobby just simply when I started reading a very interesting book and I know for a fact that books improve your vocabulary, give you information and knowledge and make your mind fresh, YOU should also start reading!</p>
